# MealRelief

Restaurants and grocery stores generate food waste every day. Food waste contributes to global warming. About 11% of all the greenhouse gas emissions that come from the food system could be reduced if we stop wasting food. Given that the Canadian food industry generates more than 11 million tonnes of rescuable waste every year, it’s clear that these extra meals are going into the wrong hands.

MealRelief connects food providers with those in need of help, or in hunger. It is available as a web app that allows users to anonymously claim servings of food donation. MealRelief is built with React and Django, and leverages Azure’s Maps API.
